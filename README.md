<h1>ProjectsRepresentation - Centralized Image Repository</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to ProjectsRepresentation, centralized storage for images featured in the README files of my various projects.</br>
  Each folder within this repository contains images that visually represent specific projects, providing a streamlined way to display and manage the views of my projects.
</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
  This repository serves two primary purposes
  <ul>
    <li>Centralized Image Storage: Eliminate image duplication across multiple repositories by establishing this repository as the singular source for all project-related ReadMe images.</li>
    <li>Streamlined README Files: Leverage this centralized image repository to simplify the markdown syntax in README files of other projects. This approach enhances documentation clarity, making each repository's README cleaner and more manageable.</li>
  </ul>
